#Animations

###Tests using mainly HTML5 canvas, two.js and three.js but also the tween.js and createjs libraries.

I have just been writing small samples of code to understand how these libraries work and getting to know their syntax.

You can find more about them here:

- two.js: http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/
- three.js: http://threejs.org/
- tween.js: https://github.com/sole/tween.js/
- createJS: http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS
